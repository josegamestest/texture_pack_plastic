## Plastic like textures for minetest
Clean texture with a plastic look, Designed by me based on the standard minetest textures, It is little different from the design, but they are cleaner and with time they will be modified to have more different characteristics.
I didn't make modifications for mods and only for minetesgame, so any texture to enter the package needs to be thought about and added. any mod not included will have its visial unchanged.
Play and use on your servers at will, if you have any doubts about the mods, read the standard minetest license on the media. because the standard licenses and I preferred to leave it like that, following the standard vision of the game.
