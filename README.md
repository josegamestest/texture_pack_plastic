# Texture_pack_plastic
## Plastic like textures for minetest
It took a lot of work to do but it was worth it.
have a clean texture to play and see the minetest very different
Some textures I designed, others I modified from the game
This does not change the fact that it took a lot of work to work on each one, I count on everyone's understanding,
Play and use it on your servers, if you have any doubts about the modified ones, read the standard minetest license about the modified midisa
because their licenses I preferred to leave it like this
